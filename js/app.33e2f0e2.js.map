<p>JSONP并不是一个好的跨域解决方案，它至少有着下面两个严重问题：</p><ol>\r\n        <li><strong>会打乱服务器的消息格式</strong>：JSONP要求服务器响应一段JS代码，但在非跨域的情况下，服务器又需要响应一个正常的JSON格式</li>\r\n        <li><strong>只能完成GET请求</strong>：JSONP的原理会要求浏览器端生成一个<code>script</code>元素，而<code>script</code>元素发出的请求只能是<code>get</code>请求</li>\r\n        </ol>\r\n        <p>所以，CORS是一种更好的跨域解决方案。</p><h1

</figure><p>而要知道，一个请求可以附带很多信息，从而会对服务器造成不同程度的影响</p><p>比如有的请求只是获取一些新闻，有的请求会改动服务器的数据</p><p>针对不同的请求，CORS规定了三种不同的交互模式，分别是：</p><ul>\r\n        <li><strong>简单请求</strong></li>\r\n        <li><strong>需要预检的请求</strong></li>\r\n        <li><strong>附带身份凭证的请求</strong></li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <p>这三种模式从上到下层层递进，请求可以做的事越来越多，要求也越来越严格。</p><p>下面分别说明三种请求模式的具体规范。</p><h1
